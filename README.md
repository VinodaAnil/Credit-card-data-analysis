This is machine learning project

Technologies:  Python, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, One HotEncoding, Random forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayess

Responsibilities:
•	Done exploratory analysis and took inferences by visualization the data
•	Doing Customer interaction and understanding the requirement 
•	Improvised the quality of data by removing inconsistent data, missing values and label the data using feature scaling
•	Removed insignificant variables using Dimensionality reduction technique
•	Used kernel SVM for nonlinear separable data
•	Applied machine learning algoriths  to validate clusters
•	Performed algorithms like K-NN, NAÏVE BAYES, Decision Tree Classifier,  Random forest and obtained optimal sensitivity and specificity with logistic regression
•	Optimized the accuracy through confusion matrix and validated model accuracy
